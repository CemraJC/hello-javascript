# Hello JavaScript!

Welcome to the repository for **Hello JavaScript** - a huge series of tutorials that are designed specifically to take JavaScript newcomers to a stage where they can write production level code. This series was definitely inspired by the current lack of quality explanation out there when it comes to JavaScript tooling with Node and other similar platforms.

The series is well-organised into stages, so feel free to skip past the bits you're confident with.
